# Getting Started


## Step 1: Clone the repository

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/MyTasks.git
cd MyTasks
```
## Step 2: Install dependencies:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn install
```

## Step 3: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

# Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰
You've successfully installed and run MyTasks React Native App. ðŸ¥³
